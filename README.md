This project is a personal portfolio website designed and developed to showcase my skills, projects, and interests as a frontend web developer. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website features a clean and modern design, responsive layout, and interactive elements to engage visitors.

The homepage introduces me with a warm greeting, a photo, and a short description of my passion for web development. The navigation bar allows smooth scrolling between sections like About, Projects, and Contact. In the "Projects" section, I’ve included a curated list of personal projects such as a Tic Tac Toe Game, Stopwatch, Amazon Clone, and more—each representing a step in my development journey.

The site also includes a responsive mobile menu, stylish typography using Google Fonts, and a functional contact form for inquiries or collaboration. This portfolio not only reflects my technical skills but also my personality and creativity.
